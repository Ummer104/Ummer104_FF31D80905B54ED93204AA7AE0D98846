#Write a function called linear_search_product that takes the list of products and a target product name as input. The function should perform a linear search to find the target product in the list and return a list of indices of all occurrences of the product if found, or an empty list if the product is not found.

def linearSearch(array, n, x):

    # Going through array sequencially
    for i in range(0, n):
        if (array[i] == x):
            return i
    return -1


array = ["shoes","sandel","loafer","shoes","shoes"]
x = "sandel"
n = len(array)
result = linearSearch(array, n, x)
if(result == -1):
    print("Element not found")
else:
    print("Element found at index: ", result)
